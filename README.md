# RNA-seq-data-exploration-app

<div style='text-align: right'> 
  This R-shinny app is designed for the user to explore my bulk RNA seq datasets. The user can generate basic plots such as volcano, heatmaps, venn diagrams. 
  The user can perform basic analysis on the dataset such GO term analysis, KEGG and Reactome pathway analysis. 

  The current dataset is designed for zebrafish analysis, future versions may have mouse and human models included for the user to try out. This is a resource for 
  zebrafish (Danio rerio) transcriptomics analysis.
